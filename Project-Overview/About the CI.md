#What is iPlant?

Quite simply, the iPlant Collaborative is a cyberinfrastructure focused on life science research. A cyberinfrastructure is data storage, software, high-performance computing, and people 
â€“ organized into systems that solve problems of size and scope that would not otherwise be solvable. The iPlant cyberinfrastructure provides a number of resources to scientists
including software platforms, analysis tools, and pre-existing datasets. In addition, iPlant offers big data storage, computing power, and training and support for new iPlant members or new researchers.

In all this, iPlant provides most of the pieces for you to do any type of higher-level computing project. 
In a sense, iPlant acts as a set of CI Lego blocks: if a tool already in place doesn't quite fit your needs, you can just create your own
using the existing CI blocks, so to speak. 

The iPlant Collaborative offers several key products, including:
* *Atmosphere:* An isolated, cloud-computing environment that allows you to launch your own software on a virtual machine
and share any piece of software moved onto that virtual machine with others via imaging

* *Discovery Environment:*  The main web interface to access the storage and analysis resources of the cyberinfrastructure; smooth integration with Data Store and 
forum dedicated to answering questions

* *Data Store:* Data storage area for both community files and personal storage with Windows Explorer-esque interface; each iPlant member has 100 GB of storage on the Data Store by default

* *DNA Subway:* Organizer of bioinformatics tools into workflows for high-level genome analysis; provides smooth interface and options for gene prediction, gene annotation, 
relationship determination, and more

* *Bisque:* Web-based system for image storage, management, and analysis; integrated with Data Store and the iPlant authentication system for computational scalability

Because all of these products are integrated into the iPlant cyberinfrastructure, they are scalable to "big data" levels of analysis previously thought impossible; however, most of the
cyberinfrastructure depends on community contributions from scientists like yourself. IPlant has thought ahead in this regard: each of the above products has extensive documentation in the iPlant wiki
and functional APIs. Beyond that, iPlant takes a developer friendly approach in interacting with systems such as frequent hack-a-thons and interfaces for making documentation writing easier.
