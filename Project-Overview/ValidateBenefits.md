#Why use the Validate Workflow?

Using the Validate Workflow offers several benefits to you, the reseacher, in interacting with your data. In fact, the
benefits go even beyond the way you interact with your data, as Simulate even helps you generate the known-truth data you need with a large numbers of files (or iterations if generated on the fly) 
and a range of important SNP alleles present.  

Validation is the positive control for your experimental data analysis.  You have control over how long data analysis takes (whereas you rarely have control over the time it takes to obtain grant funding or time-to-publication). 
Completing your positive controls first allows you to be ready for your data when you get it. Why validate a particular data analysis?
* trust but verify...check that a widely used method will work for your data
* have analysis pipeline optimized; the moment you've collected all your data you can start the analysis (saving weeks or months to complete afterwards)
* fewer requests from reviewers for changes to your data analysis methods
* be confident you are doing the best possible data analysis

Fortunately, the workflow is versatile enough to handle you importing your GWAS tools, functions, or simulation methods to use in conjunction with the existing software. 
Speaking of imports, Validate is capable of handling a range of file formats, and each piece of software is very customizable. You have 
multiple options for adjusting your output each step of the way. 

Finally, since the analysis are run on the NSF-supported national XSEDE computer systems, scalability of simulations is a non-issue;
the computational demand for your simulations will scale up as your needs increase. All of your necessary files may then be stored either on the Stampede supercomputer (1 TB of storage per user)
or the iPlant Data Store (100 GB per user with the option to receive more).
